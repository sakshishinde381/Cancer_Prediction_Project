# Cancer_Prediction_Project

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of cancer based on various health parameters provided by the user.

##  Project Summary

This project was developed during my Data Science internship. It focuses on using supervised learning models to detect potential cancer risks from user-input data. The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, and for the prediction I have used various algorithms.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface
- Real-time prediction based on input health data
- Multiple ML model support (KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree)
- Model performance metrics included
- Modular architecture for ease of future upgrades

## Machine Learning Models Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naïve Bayes
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Deployment**: (Not deployed yet, runs locally)
